1:  echo "Sample data for link testing" > sample_data.txt
   -This command creates a file named sample_data.txt and writes sample text into it.
2:  ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt
   -This command creates a hard link pointing to the same inode as the original file.
3:  ln -s sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt
   -This command creates a symbolic link that references the original file path.
4:  ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt
   -This command displays inode numbers for each file.
5: sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because a hard link points to the same file data, while the symbolic link has a different inode.
6:  stat sample_data.txt
   -This command displays detailed metadata including permissions, timestamps, and file size.
7:  du ~ --human-readable
   -Displays disk usage in human readable format
8:  ls -lh ~
   -This command lists file sizes of the home directory in a readable format such as KB or MB.
9:  rm sample_soft.txt
    ls sample_data.txt
   -This confirms that deleting a symbolic link does not affect the original file.
10: du -h --max-depth=1 ~
    df -h
   -du shows directory-wise disk usage, while df displays filesystem-level disk space usage.
